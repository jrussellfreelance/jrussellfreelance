### I'm Jesse.
My passion is automation. I love building processes and writing scripts to save someone time.

My biggest areas of expertise mostly involve things like server-side scripting and configuration.

Right now I’m a freelancer and a consultant. I’ve also worked for various tech startups in the Indianapolis area.

I consider myself a clever solution architect that automates my clients’ processes so that they can focus on bigger things.

I am also a developer, so I have the ability to diagnose a wide range of issues, maintaining the solutions I develop.
