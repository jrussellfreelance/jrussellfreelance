#### I'm Jesse, a passionate freelancer and consultant.

I design and code technical solutions for clients with an emphasis on scripting and automation development.

My areas of expertise primarily involve tasks like web scraping, server-side scripting, API development, and administration of all kinds.

I’m currently a freelancer and a consultant. I’ve also worked for various tech startups in the Indianapolis area.

I consider myself a clever solution designer that automates my clients’ processes, solving their problems so that they can focus on bigger things.

I am also a developer, so I have the ability to diagnose a wide range of issues, maintaining the solutions I develop.
